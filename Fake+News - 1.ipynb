       "\"In 2008, in the high-profile Supreme Court gun-rights case called District of Columbia v. Heller, a brief was filed from the eighth floor of the Price Daniel Sr. State Office Building in Austin, Texas, specifically from the corner office of the man who was then the state’s solicitor general, Ted Cruz.\\n\\nThe brief took a strong stance on the divisive question of whether the Second Amendment establishes an individual right to own guns, or just protects state and local militias. The brief argued forcefully for the first view, writing that “the individual right to keep and bear arms” is a “fundamental right” and that “an individual right that can be altogether abrogated is no right at all.” Thirty attorneys general from other states signed on.\\n\\nToday, with the White House pushing new gun restrictions and Cruz's candidacy riding on next month's Iowa caucuses, it's no surprise that the Texas Republican would embrace gun rights as a defining issue, holding an event at a firing range and even raffling off an engraved 12-gauge shotgun as a campaign promotion.\\n\\nIn 2008, the situation was very different: he was wading into a case that had no immediate connection to Texas at all. But to see the signature of R. Ted Cruz on the brief would not have surprised the nine Supreme Court justices in the least. By that time, Cruz had been solicitor general for five years, and inserting himself into a case of wide prominence and importance regardless of any direct tie to Texas had become part of his playbook. He clearly saw the Heller case as a watershed in gun rights, writing that it would “determine whether the Second Amendment has any modern relevance.” And he was right. The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision shot down the Washington, D.C., handgun ban and ruled for the first time in the history of this country that the amendment ensures an individual person’s right to have a gun for self-defense. The National Rifle Association recognized Cruz’s role with a resolution.\\n\\nAs Cruz climbs to the top of the Republican presidential field, the five-plus years he served as the solicitor general of Texas remain the most important period in his public résumé. They’re the record he ran on when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012—and they represent significantly more of his working life than the three years he has served so far in the Senate. They're also a prime source of fodder for liberal and moderate critics, should be become the Republican presidential nominee.\\n\\nA Politico review of Cruz’s record as solicitor general shows he used the role in a new and far more ideological way than his predecessors, taking a relatively low-profile job that had traditionally been used mostly to defend the state government and turning it into a stage for pushing national conservative causes. Cruz argued eight cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court—far more than his predecessors and successors—using each of them to advance a position endorsed by conservative thinkers. He also was the counsel of record on some 70 friend-of-the-court briefs, or amicus briefs, weighing in on cases across the country, like Heller, in which Texas had no direct stake, but which similarly offered a chance to argue ideological points.\\n\\n“He really turned the office into a platform,” David Bernstein, a George Mason law professor who recently wrote a book about the Obama administration for which Cruz wrote the foreword, said in an interview.\\n\\n“He built up the national aura of the office,” said Tom Phillips, who was the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Texas at the start of Cruz’s run as solicitor general.\\n\\nCruz’s zealous work served the ambitions of the conservative movement, but he also personally used it to build a bridge between what he was (an elite constitutional law nerd) to what he is today (an ascendant right-wing politician). Yet while pleasing to conservatives, other aspects of his record are sure to attract critics. He argued against leniency for an unjustly sentenced man whose lawyer had made a technical mistake; he invoked 13th-century “Saxon law” and the practice of cutting off testicles to justify harsher punishments in a rape case; and he referred to a late-term abortion technique as “infanticide.”\\n\\nAlthough little examined in the race so far, Cruz’s time as solicitor general built him a powerful allegiance among the conservative donors necessary to launch a national campaign. Heading into Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and beyond, he has more money at his disposal than any candidate besides Jeb Bush. And the way he used that Texas office is part of the reason. Toby Neugebauer, who wrote a $10 million check to the Cruz super PAC called Keep the Promise II, told me the reason he did that—the single reason—is what Cruz did as solicitor general. He said other major donors feel the same way.\\n\\n“We’re backing someone,” Neugebauer told me, “that had a worldview and went out and executed on it.”\\n\\nCruz took the solicitor job as a reboot of sorts after his initial foray into politics had fizzled.\\n\\nAs a debater at Princeton, as a law school student at Harvard, and as a clerk to then-Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Cruz was widely considered brilliant—but he left his first real job as a promising appellate attorney in private practice in Washington to instead toil in 2000 as a domestic policy analyst in George W. Bush’s presidential campaign, then as a legal hand for Bush’s team in the frantic recount in Florida that ultimately won Bush the election.\\n\\nIn return, Cruz “desperately” wanted “a senior post” in the White House, he wrote in his autobiography. On the campaign, though, he had earned a reputation for his outsized ego as much as for his obvious intelligence, and the post-election jobs he got were out-of-the-way roles at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. “I just don’t like the guy,” Bush has said since. The solicitor general role in his home state of Texas, offered to him by Greg Abbott—then the attorney general of Texas, now the governor—was a political lifeline.\\n\\nFrom the start, it offered a chance to turn his legal acumen into political potential, because it came with a green light to advance conservative aims in the courts. Abbott’s directive for the solicitor general of Texas, Cruz said in his book, was to “look across the country” and “identify chances to defend conservative principles.”\\n\\nThis is not the traditional definition of a solicitor general’s job, which comes with two main duties. The first: States get sued, attorneys general and their staffs respond, and some of the cases get appealed—and that’s where the solicitor general comes in, representing the state in higher courts, where the cases are the most legalistic and complex. The second: the writing of amicus briefs in cases elsewhere in which a state believes it has an interest even though it’s not a party.\\n\\nThe first part can be seen as defense. The second part is more like offense, selectively advancing the interests of the state. The way Cruz did the job? Even the defense was offense, and the interests being asserted were less those of the state than its conservative leaders.\\n\\n“Texas is a huge state, and there’s plenty of work for the attorney general’s office to do,” said Jim Ho, an attorney in Dallas who succeeded Cruz as solicitor general and is a friend and supporter. Cruz, though, “was not content to simply do what was asked and go home.”\\n\\nWhen it came to cases that allowed him to argue for things like the forceful application of the death penalty and expressions of religion in the public arena and against things like abortion and gun control, Ho told me, Cruz “was on constant watch for opportunities to press a conservative vision of the Constitution.”\""

       " i was so angry that , young as i was , i began to plead with them to come to their senses . xxmaj no one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet , for the first time in my life , i felt something like righteous indignation . i suspect that , born and raised in xxmaj america , i was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that i just could n’t fathom the immense danger i was in . xxmaj certainly , i was acting in ways no native xxmaj iranian would have found reasonable . \n",
       " xxmaj across the smoke - filled courtyard , i saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit . i spotted an xxmaj american flag still burning , dropped to my knees , and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate ’s feet . xxmaj as the soldier closed in on me , i ducked and ran , still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion . xxmaj the events of that day would come to define all that i have ever stood for — or against . \n",

       " xxmaj when i took my oath of enlistment in the xxup u.s. xxmaj navy , i gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos , but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet . xxmaj she cried even harder when i was selected to serve as the first xxmaj muslim - xxmaj american member of the xxup u.s. xxmaj navy xxmaj presidential xxmaj ceremonial xxmaj honor xxmaj guard . xxmaj on that day , i was proud , too , and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced . \n",
       " xxmaj being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me . xxmaj it caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people . xxmaj somehow , i grasped that , if it were n’t for a fear of the unknown , there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me . xxmaj often , i discovered , those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families , friends , or even strangers . i realized , then , that if , despite everything , i could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness , i might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me , too , and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate . \n",
       " xxmaj through patience , humor , and understanding , i was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “ otherness ” of so much that xxmaj americans found scary . xxmaj to this day , i have friends from elementary school , middle school , high school , and the military who tell me that i am the only xxmaj muslim they have ever known and that , had they not met me , their perspective on xxmaj islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear - based narrative that has poisoned this country since xxmaj september 11 , 2001 . \n",

       " xxmaj in the wake of 9 / 11 , i began to observe how so many of my fellow xxmaj americans were adopting a fundamentalist “ us vs. them ” attitude towards xxmaj muslims and xxmaj islam . i suddenly found myself in an xxmaj america where the scattered insults i had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form , where they became something like an ideology and way of life . \n",
       " xxmaj by the time i completed my military service in 2006 , i had begun to understand that our policies in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , similarly disturbed , seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare . xxmaj that , in turn , was made possible by the creation of a new enemy : xxmaj islam — or rather of a portrait , painted by the powers - that - be , of xxmaj islam as a terror religion , as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert , waiting to destroy us . i knew that attempting to dispel , through the patient approach of my childhood , the kind of xxmaj islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough . xxmaj post-9 / 11 attacks on xxmaj muslims in the xxup u.s. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts . \n",
       " xxmaj for the first time in my life , in a country gripped by fear , i believed i was witnessing a shift , en masse , toward an xxmaj american fundamentalism and ultra - nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason , not to mention fact . xxmaj as a boy in xxmaj iran , i had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country . xxmaj now , it seemed to me , in xxmaj america ’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , and xxunk the hallmarks of our founding , we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat . \n",

       " xxmaj our group was born of the belief that , as xxmaj american military veterans , we had a responsibility to call out bigotry , hatred , and the perpetuation of endless warfare . xxmaj we want the xxmaj american xxmaj muslim community to know that they have allies , and that those allies are indeed veterans as well . xxmaj we stand with them and for them and , for those of us who are xxmaj muslim , among them . \n",
       " xxmaj nationalism and xenophobia have no place in xxmaj american life , and i , for my part , do n’t think xxmaj donald xxmaj trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle xxmaj islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity . xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , there no longer exists a “ clash of civilizations . ” xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , whatever the problems in the world may be , there is no longer an “ us vs. them ” and it ’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war . \n",

       " xxmaj being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me . xxmaj it caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people . xxmaj somehow , i grasped that , if it were n’t for a fear of the unknown , there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me . xxmaj often , i discovered , those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families , friends , or even strangers . i realized , then , that if , despite everything , i could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness , i might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me , too , and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate . \n",

       " i was so angry that , young as i was , i began to plead with them to come to their senses . xxmaj no one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet , for the first time in my life , i felt something like righteous indignation . i suspect that , born and raised in xxmaj america , i was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that i just could n’t fathom the immense danger i was in . xxmaj certainly , i was acting in ways no native xxmaj iranian would have found reasonable . \n",

       " xxmaj being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me . xxmaj it caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people . xxmaj somehow , i grasped that , if it were n’t for a fear of the unknown , there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me . xxmaj often , i discovered , those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families , friends , or even strangers . i realized , then , that if , despite everything , i could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness , i might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me , too , and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate . \n",

       " xxmaj in the wake of 9 / 11 , i began to observe how so many of my fellow xxmaj americans were adopting a fundamentalist “ us vs. them ” attitude towards xxmaj muslims and xxmaj islam . i suddenly found myself in an xxmaj america where the scattered insults i had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form , where they became something like an ideology and way of life . \n",
       " xxmaj by the time i completed my military service in 2006 , i had begun to understand that our policies in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , similarly disturbed , seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare . xxmaj that , in turn , was made possible by the creation of a new enemy : xxmaj islam — or rather of a portrait , painted by the powers - that - be , of xxmaj islam as a terror religion , as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert , waiting to destroy us . i knew that attempting to dispel , through the patient approach of my childhood , the kind of xxmaj islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough . xxmaj post-9 / 11 attacks on xxmaj muslims in the xxup u.s. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts . \n",
       " xxmaj for the first time in my life , in a country gripped by fear , i believed i was witnessing a shift , en masse , toward an xxmaj american fundamentalism and ultra - nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason , not to mention fact . xxmaj as a boy in xxmaj iran , i had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country . xxmaj now , it seemed to me , in xxmaj america ’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , and xxunk the hallmarks of our founding , we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat . \n",

       " xxmaj the incident in xxmaj chapel xxmaj hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation i had felt so many years earlier in that smoke - filled courtyard in xxmaj iran . i would be damned if i stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith . xxmaj it violated every word of the oath i had taken when i joined the military and xxunk every value i held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation . xxmaj white nationalists and bigots had , by then , thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this , using xxmaj islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the xxmaj united xxmaj states . xxmaj this was terrorism , pure and simple , inspired by hate - speakers here at home . \n",
       " xxmaj at that moment , i reached out to fellow veterans who , i thought , might be willing to help — and it ’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other . xxmaj when i contacted xxmaj veterans xxmaj for xxmaj peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism , i found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of xxmaj islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy . xxmaj so xxmaj executive xxmaj director xxmaj michael xxunk formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon — and i , of course , joined it . \n",

       " xxmaj our group was born of the belief that , as xxmaj american military veterans , we had a responsibility to call out bigotry , hatred , and the perpetuation of endless warfare . xxmaj we want the xxmaj american xxmaj muslim community to know that they have allies , and that those allies are indeed veterans as well . xxmaj we stand with them and for them and , for those of us who are xxmaj muslim , among them . \n",
       " xxmaj nationalism and xenophobia have no place in xxmaj american life , and i , for my part , do n’t think xxmaj donald xxmaj trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle xxmaj islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity . xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , there no longer exists a “ clash of civilizations . ” xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , whatever the problems in the world may be , there is no longer an “ us vs. them ” and it ’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war . \n",

       " i was so angry that , young as i was , i began to plead with them to come to their senses . xxmaj no one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet , for the first time in my life , i felt something like righteous indignation . i suspect that , born and raised in xxmaj america , i was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that i just could n’t fathom the immense danger i was in . xxmaj certainly , i was acting in ways no native xxmaj iranian would have found reasonable . \n",
       " xxmaj across the smoke - filled courtyard , i saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit . i spotted an xxmaj american flag still burning , dropped to my knees , and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate ’s feet . xxmaj as the soldier closed in on me , i ducked and ran , still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion . xxmaj the events of that day would come to define all that i have ever stood for — or against . \n",

       " xxmaj yet i remember that tingling in my chest when i first donned my xxmaj cub xxmaj scout uniform — all because of the xxmaj american flag patch on its shoulder . xxmaj something felt so good about wearing it , a feeling i still had when i joined the military . xxmaj it seems that the flag i tried to rescue in xxmaj tehran was stapled to my heart , or that ’s how i felt anyway as i wore my country ’s uniform . \n",
       " xxmaj when i took my oath of enlistment in the xxup u.s. xxmaj navy , i gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos , but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet . xxmaj she cried even harder when i was selected to serve as the first xxmaj muslim - xxmaj american member of the xxup u.s. xxmaj navy xxmaj presidential xxmaj ceremonial xxmaj honor xxmaj guard . xxmaj on that day , i was proud , too , and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced . \n",
       " xxmaj being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me . xxmaj it caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people . xxmaj somehow , i grasped that , if it were n’t for a fear of the unknown , there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me . xxmaj often , i discovered , those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families , friends , or even strangers . i realized , then , that if , despite everything , i could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness , i might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me , too , and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate . \n",
       " xxmaj through patience , humor , and understanding , i was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “ otherness ” of so much that xxmaj americans found scary . xxmaj to this day , i have friends from elementary school , middle school , high school , and the military who tell me that i am the only xxmaj muslim they have ever known and that , had they not met me , their perspective on xxmaj islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear - based narrative that has poisoned this country since xxmaj september 11 , 2001 . \n",

       " xxmaj in the wake of 9 / 11 , i began to observe how so many of my fellow xxmaj americans were adopting a fundamentalist “ us vs. them ” attitude towards xxmaj muslims and xxmaj islam . i suddenly found myself in an xxmaj america where the scattered insults i had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form , where they became something like an ideology and way of life . \n",
       " xxmaj by the time i completed my military service in 2006 , i had begun to understand that our policies in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , similarly disturbed , seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare . xxmaj that , in turn , was made possible by the creation of a new enemy : xxmaj islam — or rather of a portrait , painted by the powers - that - be , of xxmaj islam as a terror religion , as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert , waiting to destroy us . i knew that attempting to dispel , through the patient approach of my childhood , the kind of xxmaj islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough . xxmaj post-9 / 11 attacks on xxmaj muslims in the xxup u.s. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts . \n",
       " xxmaj for the first time in my life , in a country gripped by fear , i believed i was witnessing a shift , en masse , toward an xxmaj american fundamentalism and ultra - nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason , not to mention fact . xxmaj as a boy in xxmaj iran , i had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country . xxmaj now , it seemed to me , in xxmaj america ’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , and xxunk the hallmarks of our founding , we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat . \n",

       " xxmaj the incident in xxmaj chapel xxmaj hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation i had felt so many years earlier in that smoke - filled courtyard in xxmaj iran . i would be damned if i stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith . xxmaj it violated every word of the oath i had taken when i joined the military and xxunk every value i held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation . xxmaj white nationalists and bigots had , by then , thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this , using xxmaj islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the xxmaj united xxmaj states . xxmaj this was terrorism , pure and simple , inspired by hate - speakers here at home . \n",
       " xxmaj at that moment , i reached out to fellow veterans who , i thought , might be willing to help — and it ’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other . xxmaj when i contacted xxmaj veterans xxmaj for xxmaj peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism , i found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of xxmaj islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy . xxmaj so xxmaj executive xxmaj director xxmaj michael xxunk formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon — and i , of course , joined it . \n",

       " xxmaj our group was born of the belief that , as xxmaj american military veterans , we had a responsibility to call out bigotry , hatred , and the perpetuation of endless warfare . xxmaj we want the xxmaj american xxmaj muslim community to know that they have allies , and that those allies are indeed veterans as well . xxmaj we stand with them and for them and , for those of us who are xxmaj muslim , among them . \n",
       " xxmaj nationalism and xenophobia have no place in xxmaj american life , and i , for my part , do n’t think xxmaj donald xxmaj trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle xxmaj islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity . xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , there no longer exists a “ clash of civilizations . ” xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , whatever the problems in the world may be , there is no longer an “ us vs. them ” and it ’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war . \n",

       " xxmaj through patience , humor , and understanding , i was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “ otherness ” of so much that xxmaj americans found scary . xxmaj to this day , i have friends from elementary school , middle school , high school , and the military who tell me that i am the only xxmaj muslim they have ever known and that , had they not met me , their perspective on xxmaj islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear - based narrative that has poisoned this country since xxmaj september 11 , 2001 . \n",

       " xxmaj by the time i completed my military service in 2006 , i had begun to understand that our policies in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , similarly disturbed , seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare . xxmaj that , in turn , was made possible by the creation of a new enemy : xxmaj islam — or rather of a portrait , painted by the powers - that - be , of xxmaj islam as a terror religion , as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert , waiting to destroy us . i knew that attempting to dispel , through the patient approach of my childhood , the kind of xxmaj islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough . xxmaj post-9 / 11 attacks on xxmaj muslims in the xxup u.s. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts . \n",
       " xxmaj for the first time in my life , in a country gripped by fear , i believed i was witnessing a shift , en masse , toward an xxmaj american fundamentalism and ultra - nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason , not to mention fact . xxmaj as a boy in xxmaj iran , i had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country . xxmaj now , it seemed to me , in xxmaj america ’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , and xxunk the hallmarks of our founding , we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat . \n",

       " xxmaj the incident in xxmaj chapel xxmaj hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation i had felt so many years earlier in that smoke - filled courtyard in xxmaj iran . i would be damned if i stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith . xxmaj it violated every word of the oath i had taken when i joined the military and xxunk every value i held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation . xxmaj white nationalists and bigots had , by then , thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this , using xxmaj islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the xxmaj united xxmaj states . xxmaj this was terrorism , pure and simple , inspired by hate - speakers here at home . \n",
       " xxmaj at that moment , i reached out to fellow veterans who , i thought , might be willing to help — and it ’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other . xxmaj when i contacted xxmaj veterans xxmaj for xxmaj peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism , i found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of xxmaj islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy . xxmaj so xxmaj executive xxmaj director xxmaj michael xxunk formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon — and i , of course , joined it . \n",

       " xxmaj our group was born of the belief that , as xxmaj american military veterans , we had a responsibility to call out bigotry , hatred , and the perpetuation of endless warfare . xxmaj we want the xxmaj american xxmaj muslim community to know that they have allies , and that those allies are indeed veterans as well . xxmaj we stand with them and for them and , for those of us who are xxmaj muslim , among them . \n",
       " xxmaj nationalism and xenophobia have no place in xxmaj american life , and i , for my part , do n’t think xxmaj donald xxmaj trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle xxmaj islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity . xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , there no longer exists a “ clash of civilizations . ” xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , whatever the problems in the world may be , there is no longer an “ us vs. them ” and it ’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war . \n",

       " xxmaj let 's start with that xxmaj bloomberg poll . xxmaj one important caveat of this poll is that it 's primary voters , not all xxup gop voters . xxmaj conventional wisdom says that primary voters ( of either party ) tend to have more extreme views than voters writ large , but they are who pick a nominee . \n",

       "\n",
       " xxmaj rather , a bigger phenomenon may be at work in why xxmaj trump and his ideas are so popular : polarization . xxmaj it 's not clear whether xxmaj americans are growing more polarized ideologically ( that is , whether their ideas are growing further apart politically ) . xxmaj what is clearer is that xxmaj americans are experiencing more xxunk polarization — that is , regardless of where their views are moving , liberals increasingly dislike conservatives , and conservatives increasingly dislike liberals . \n",

       "\n",
       " xxmaj polarization may also contribute to why xxmaj trump seems to have a xxmaj teflon skin when it comes to fact checks . xxmaj he has over the years claimed that xxmaj obama was n't born in the xxup u.s. and , more recently , that there were \" thousands and thousands \" of xxmaj muslims in xxmaj new xxmaj jersey cheering the attacks on the xxmaj world xxmaj trade xxmaj center . xxmaj he has n't disavowed those ideas — even given repeated fact checks . \n",

       " xxmaj in the wake of 9 / 11 , i began to observe how so many of my fellow xxmaj americans were adopting a fundamentalist “ us vs. them ” attitude towards xxmaj muslims and xxmaj islam . i suddenly found myself in an xxmaj america where the scattered insults i had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form , where they became something like an ideology and way of life . \n",
       " xxmaj by the time i completed my military service in 2006 , i had begun to understand that our policies in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , similarly disturbed , seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare . xxmaj that , in turn , was made possible by the creation of a new enemy : xxmaj islam — or rather of a portrait , painted by the powers - that - be , of xxmaj islam as a terror religion , as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert , waiting to destroy us . i knew that attempting to dispel , through the patient approach of my childhood , the kind of xxmaj islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough . xxmaj post-9 / 11 attacks on xxmaj muslims in the xxup u.s. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts . \n",
       " xxmaj for the first time in my life , in a country gripped by fear , i believed i was witnessing a shift , en masse , toward an xxmaj american fundamentalism and ultra - nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason , not to mention fact . xxmaj as a boy in xxmaj iran , i had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country . xxmaj now , it seemed to me , in xxmaj america ’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , and xxunk the hallmarks of our founding , we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat . \n",

       " xxmaj the incident in xxmaj chapel xxmaj hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation i had felt so many years earlier in that smoke - filled courtyard in xxmaj iran . i would be damned if i stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith . xxmaj it violated every word of the oath i had taken when i joined the military and xxunk every value i held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation . xxmaj white nationalists and bigots had , by then , thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this , using xxmaj islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the xxmaj united xxmaj states . xxmaj this was terrorism , pure and simple , inspired by hate - speakers here at home . \n",
       " xxmaj at that moment , i reached out to fellow veterans who , i thought , might be willing to help — and it ’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other . xxmaj when i contacted xxmaj veterans xxmaj for xxmaj peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism , i found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of xxmaj islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy . xxmaj so xxmaj executive xxmaj director xxmaj michael xxunk formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon — and i , of course , joined it . \n",

       " xxmaj our group was born of the belief that , as xxmaj american military veterans , we had a responsibility to call out bigotry , hatred , and the perpetuation of endless warfare . xxmaj we want the xxmaj american xxmaj muslim community to know that they have allies , and that those allies are indeed veterans as well . xxmaj we stand with them and for them and , for those of us who are xxmaj muslim , among them . \n",
       " xxmaj nationalism and xenophobia have no place in xxmaj american life , and i , for my part , do n’t think xxmaj donald xxmaj trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle xxmaj islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity . xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , there no longer exists a “ clash of civilizations . ” xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , whatever the problems in the world may be , there is no longer an “ us vs. them ” and it ’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war . \n",

       " xxmaj let 's start with that xxmaj bloomberg poll . xxmaj one important caveat of this poll is that it 's primary voters , not all xxup gop voters . xxmaj conventional wisdom says that primary voters ( of either party ) tend to have more extreme views than voters writ large , but they are who pick a nominee . \n",
       "\n",
       " xxmaj it 's true that xxmaj americans view xxmaj muslims more negatively than they do any other major religious group , as xxmaj pew found in a 2014 study . xxmaj on a \" feelings thermometer \" of 0 ( most \" cold \" or negative ) to 100 , xxmaj muslims scored a 40 , on par with atheists ' 41 . xxmaj at the other end were xxmaj jews , xxmaj catholics and evangelical xxmaj christians , at 63 , 62 , and 61 , respectively . \n",

       "\n",
       " xxmaj rather , a bigger phenomenon may be at work in why xxmaj trump and his ideas are so popular : polarization . xxmaj it 's not clear whether xxmaj americans are growing more polarized ideologically ( that is , whether their ideas are growing further apart politically ) . xxmaj what is clearer is that xxmaj americans are experiencing more xxunk polarization — that is , regardless of where their views are moving , liberals increasingly dislike conservatives , and conservatives increasingly dislike liberals . \n",
       "\n",
       " xxmaj for a real - world spin on this , consider that 30 percent of consistent conservatives and 23 percent of consistent liberals say they 'd be unhappy if their children married someone of the opposite party , according to a 2014 xxmaj pew poll . \n",

       " a few things have driven this dislike , as polarization expert and xxmaj vanderbilt xxmaj university professor xxmaj marc xxmaj hetherington told xxup npr last month : \n",

       " — the rise of \" gut - level \" issues like terrorism , guns and abortion as political topics ; \n",

       "\n",
       " \" xxmaj more polarization begets poor performance , which begets worse trust , which gives you worse performance , which , of course , gives you more frustration , \" xxmaj hetherington said . \n",
       "\n",
       " a xxmaj lack xxmaj of xxmaj trust xxmaj and a xxmaj want xxmaj for ' xxmaj change ' \n",

       "\n",
       " xxmaj all of that creates a perfect environment for a xxmaj trump to arise right now in the xxmaj republican xxmaj party . xxmaj lack of trust in government means xxmaj americans — particularly non - xxmaj democrats — may be particularly willing to vote for an \" outsider . \" \n",

       " xxmaj similarly , as xxmaj hetherington explained , xxmaj democrats were willing to vote for the \" outsider \" xxmaj obama after eight years of a xxmaj george xxup w. xxmaj bush presidency . xxmaj obama and xxmaj trump 's rhetoric may be vastly different , but xxmaj americans ' willingness to vote for change — even if untested — is the common factor here . \n",
       "\n",
       " xxmaj polarization may also contribute to why xxmaj trump seems to have a xxmaj teflon skin when it comes to fact checks . xxmaj he has over the years claimed that xxmaj obama was n't born in the xxup u.s. and , more recently , that there were \" thousands and thousands \" of xxmaj muslims in xxmaj new xxmaj jersey cheering the attacks on the xxmaj world xxmaj trade xxmaj center . xxmaj he has n't disavowed those ideas — even given repeated fact checks . \n",

       "\n",
       " xxmaj motivated reasoning can happen when new information challenges one 's worldview . xxmaj as political scientists from xxmaj appalachian xxmaj state xxmaj university wrote in a 2012 article , \" xxmaj when individuals engage in motivated reasoning , partisan goals trump accuracy goals . \" \n",

       " xxmaj to be clear , the willingness to believe in unsupported ideas is bipartisan . xxmaj to take an extreme example , according to research from xxmaj dartmouth xxmaj college political science professor xxmaj brendan xxmaj nyhan , xxmaj democrats were , as of 2006 ( that is , during the xxmaj bush administration ) , roughly as likely to believe that the xxmaj sept. 11 attacks were an inside job as xxmaj republicans were , as of 2010 , to believe that xxmaj obama was n't born in the xxup u.s. \n",

       " xxmaj it was xxmaj tehran , the capital of xxmaj iran , in 1985 . i was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in xxmaj western nations . xxmaj it had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for xxmaj western teaching , but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists . xxmaj as the gunfire drew closer , i heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside , marching into our building , and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom . xxmaj as i heard voices chanting “ xxmaj death to xxmaj america ! ” i remember wondering if i would survive to see my parents again . \n",
       " xxmaj in a flash of green and black uniforms , those soldiers rushed into our classroom , grabbed us by our shirt collars , and yelled at us to get outside . xxmaj we were then packed into the school ’s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up . xxmaj almost in unison , my classmates and i raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony , then set ablaze and tossed , still burning , into the courtyard . xxmaj as those flags floated to the ground in flames , the soldiers fired their guns in the air . xxmaj shouting , they ordered us — if we ever wanted to see our families again — to swear allegiance to the xxmaj grand xxmaj ayatollah xxmaj khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries . i scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and , horrified , watched them capitulate and begin to chant , “ xxmaj death to xxmaj america ! ” as they stomped on our sacred symbols . \n",
       " i was so angry that , young as i was , i began to plead with them to come to their senses . xxmaj no one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet , for the first time in my life , i felt something like righteous indignation . i suspect that , born and raised in xxmaj america , i was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that i just could n’t fathom the immense danger i was in . xxmaj certainly , i was acting in ways no native xxmaj iranian would have found reasonable . \n",
       " xxmaj across the smoke - filled courtyard , i saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit . i spotted an xxmaj american flag still burning , dropped to my knees , and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate ’s feet . xxmaj as the soldier closed in on me , i ducked and ran , still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion . xxmaj the events of that day would come to define all that i have ever stood for — or against . \n",

       " xxmaj my parents and i soon returned to the xxmaj united xxmaj states and i entered third grade . xxmaj more than anything , i just wanted to be normal , to fit in and be accepted by my peers . xxmaj unfortunately , my first name , xxmaj nader ( which i changed to xxmaj nate upon joining the xxmaj navy ) , and my swarthy xxmaj middle xxmaj eastern appearance , were little help on that score , eliciting regular jibes from my classmates . xxmaj even at that young age , they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation , including “ camel jockey , ” “ sand - nigger , ” “ xxunk , ” “ ayatollah , ” and ironically , “ xxmaj gandhi ” ( which i now take as a compliment ) . xxmaj my classmates regularly sought to “ other - ize ” me in those years , as if i were a lesser xxmaj american because of my faith and ethnicity . \n",
       " xxmaj yet i remember that tingling in my chest when i first donned my xxmaj cub xxmaj scout uniform — all because of the xxmaj american flag patch on its shoulder . xxmaj something felt so good about wearing it , a feeling i still had when i joined the military . xxmaj it seems that the flag i tried to rescue in xxmaj tehran was stapled to my heart , or that ’s how i felt anyway as i wore my country ’s uniform . \n",
       " xxmaj when i took my oath of enlistment in the xxup u.s. xxmaj navy , i gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos , but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet . xxmaj she cried even harder when i was selected to serve as the first xxmaj muslim - xxmaj american member of the xxup u.s. xxmaj navy xxmaj presidential xxmaj ceremonial xxmaj honor xxmaj guard . xxmaj on that day , i was proud , too , and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced . \n",
       " xxmaj being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me . xxmaj it caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people . xxmaj somehow , i grasped that , if it were n’t for a fear of the unknown , there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me . xxmaj often , i discovered , those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families , friends , or even strangers . i realized , then , that if , despite everything , i could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness , i might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me , too , and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate . \n",
       " xxmaj through patience , humor , and understanding , i was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “ otherness ” of so much that xxmaj americans found scary . xxmaj to this day , i have friends from elementary school , middle school , high school , and the military who tell me that i am the only xxmaj muslim they have ever known and that , had they not met me , their perspective on xxmaj islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear - based narrative that has poisoned this country since xxmaj september 11 , 2001 . \n",
       " xxmaj in 1998 , i became special assistant to the xxmaj master xxmaj chief xxmaj petty xxmaj officer of the xxmaj navy and then , in 1999 , i was recruited to serve at the xxmaj defense xxmaj intelligence xxmaj agency . xxmaj in xxmaj august 2000 , i transferred to the xxmaj naval xxmaj reserve . \n",
       " xxmaj in the wake of 9 / 11 , i began to observe how so many of my fellow xxmaj americans were adopting a fundamentalist “ us vs. them ” attitude towards xxmaj muslims and xxmaj islam . i suddenly found myself in an xxmaj america where the scattered insults i had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form , where they became something like an ideology and way of life . \n",
       " xxmaj by the time i completed my military service in 2006 , i had begun to understand that our policies in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , similarly disturbed , seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare . xxmaj that , in turn , was made possible by the creation of a new enemy : xxmaj islam — or rather of a portrait , painted by the powers - that - be , of xxmaj islam as a terror religion , as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert , waiting to destroy us . i knew that attempting to dispel , through the patient approach of my childhood , the kind of xxmaj islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough . xxmaj post-9 / 11 attacks on xxmaj muslims in the xxup u.s. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts . \n",
       " xxmaj for the first time in my life , in a country gripped by fear , i believed i was witnessing a shift , en masse , toward an xxmaj american fundamentalism and ultra - nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason , not to mention fact . xxmaj as a boy in xxmaj iran , i had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country . xxmaj now , it seemed to me , in xxmaj america ’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east , and xxunk the hallmarks of our founding , we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat . \n",

       " xxmaj the incident in xxmaj chapel xxmaj hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation i had felt so many years earlier in that smoke - filled courtyard in xxmaj iran . i would be damned if i stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith . xxmaj it violated every word of the oath i had taken when i joined the military and xxunk every value i held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation . xxmaj white nationalists and bigots had , by then , thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this , using xxmaj islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the xxmaj united xxmaj states . xxmaj this was terrorism , pure and simple , inspired by hate - speakers here at home . \n",
       " xxmaj at that moment , i reached out to fellow veterans who , i thought , might be willing to help — and it ’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other . xxmaj when i contacted xxmaj veterans xxmaj for xxmaj peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism , i found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of xxmaj islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy . xxmaj so xxmaj executive xxmaj director xxmaj michael xxunk formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon — and i , of course , joined it . \n",
       " xxmaj from that committee emerged xxmaj veterans xxmaj challenge xxmaj islamophobia ( xxup vci ) . xxmaj it now has organizers in xxmaj arizona , xxmaj georgia , xxmaj new xxmaj jersey , and xxmaj texas , and that ’s just a beginning . xxmaj totally nonpartisan , xxup vci focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech . xxmaj we ’ve met with leaders of xxmaj american xxmaj muslim communities , sat with them through xxmaj ramadan , and attended their xxmaj xxunk dinners to break our xxunk together . xxmaj in the wake of the xxmaj orlando shooting , we at xxup vci also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the xxmaj muslim community against the xxup xxunk community . \n",
       " xxmaj our group was born of the belief that , as xxmaj american military veterans , we had a responsibility to call out bigotry , hatred , and the perpetuation of endless warfare . xxmaj we want the xxmaj american xxmaj muslim community to know that they have allies , and that those allies are indeed veterans as well . xxmaj we stand with them and for them and , for those of us who are xxmaj muslim , among them . \n",
       " xxmaj nationalism and xenophobia have no place in xxmaj american life , and i , for my part , do n’t think xxmaj donald xxmaj trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle xxmaj islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity . xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , there no longer exists a “ clash of civilizations . ” xxmaj without xxmaj islamophobia , whatever the problems in the world may be , there is no longer an “ us vs. them ” and it ’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war . \n",

    "The model classifies Fake/Real by understanding the linguistic structure of the sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In our example the first example was written by me in a very rudimentary and non-formal way, like most Fake News. \n",
    "- The second one, a proper news article, is a more professional and well-written article, like most of the Real News.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations \n",
    "As this model relies on the linguistic structure of a sentence, it is <b>by far</b> not a full proof Fake News Classifer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As it relies on the structure of a sentence, a well-written <b> Fake</b> article will be not be flagged down.\n",
    "- Conversely, a poorly written <b> Real</b> article may be flagged down\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations can be undone, and am currently working on it!\n",
