This Repository houses all of my efforts in trying to use new techniques to detect Fake News. I will be adding new models, techniques regularly. 

<b>Fake News 1</b>

This uses the fake_or_real_news.csv file that was prepared by George McIntire in 2017 - see https://opendatascience.com/how-to-build-a-fake-news-classification-model/. The dataset has about 6,000 items, consisting of the headline and text of a news article and the label, FAKE or REAL.
I consistently got an accuracy of over 98% as compared to the original accuracy of  91.7% by George McIntire
